## 🎯 How to Find the Command in Discord

### Method 1: Type the Slash Command

In any channel where the bot can see:

1. Type `/setup_verification` and press Enter
2. The command should appear as an autocomplete option
3. Click it or press Enter to execute

### Method 2: Check Available Commands

1. In any channel, type just `/`
2. You should see a list of all bot commands
3. Look for "setup_verification" in the list
4. Click on it

## ⚠️ Important: Administrator Permission Required

The `/setup_verification` command requires **Administrator** permissions!

**If you can't see the command:**

- Make sure you have Administrator permission in the server
- Or make sure you have a role that has been granted permission to use this command

## 🔧 Quick Test

To verify everything is working, try these steps:

1. **Test basic commands first:**

   - Type `/ping` - This should work for everyone
   - Type `/hello` - This should also work
   - Type `/info` - Shows bot information

2. **Then try verification setup:**
   - Type `/setup_verification` - Only visible to Administrators
   - This will deploy the verification embed with button

## 📸 What You Should See

When you successfully run `/setup_verification`, you'll see:

**The Embed Message:**

- Title: "🔮 Welcome to The Chosen Frequency"
- Text about spam prevention and verification
- Purple color scheme
- A blue button labeled "✨ Verify & Join The Frequency 🔮"

**Confirmation Message (only you can see):**

- "✅ Verification message deployed in #channel-name!"

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"I don't see `/setup_verification`"**

- Check if you have Administrator permission
- Try typing the full command: `/setup_verification` and press Enter
- Wait 1-2 minutes for Discord to fully register the commands

**"Command failed when I tried to use it"**

- Make sure the bot has these permissions:
  - Send Messages
  - Embed Links
  - Manage Roles

**"I can see other commands but not this one"**

- Only Administrators can see this command (by design for security)
- Check your role permissions in Server Settings
